<p>This option can be used to import documents scanned and clasified in:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Kofax Capture</li>
    <li>Abbyy FineReader</li>
</ul>
<p>The documents are to be stored in a folder structure along with its metadata and classification in their respective standard format (XML for Abbyy and csv-txtfor Kofax).
Each folder in the file system will be created as a folder OpenProdoc, under the current folder. Documents are created according to the document type shown in the file metadata.</p>
<p> The possible options and their effects are:</p>
<ul>
    <li><b>Source System</b>: Currrently, you can select Kofax Capture and Abbyy FineReader.</li>
    <li><b>Delete after Import</b>: When checked, after the import process, all the original documents and metadata will be deleted. It is advisable to keep a copy in advance, at least until you perform your periodical OpenProdoc backup , especially if the number of documents to import is great.</li>
    <li><b>Folder Type</b>: Openprodoc folder type to be assigned to each of the file system folders imported. The folder type must not have required metadata, as initially will be empty.</li>
    <li><b>Date Format</b>: The date format with which you have saved the document metadata.</li>
    <li><b>TimeStamp Format</b>: The TimeStamp format with which you have saved the document metadata.</li>
    <li><b>Folder to be imported</b>: Indicates the file system folder from which you import the folder structure and documents.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li><b>Folder and Document types</b>: Although not necessarily be identical, must contain at least the same metadata.</li>
    <li><b>Mime Types</b>: Similarly must exist but does not have to match exactly the definition.</li>
