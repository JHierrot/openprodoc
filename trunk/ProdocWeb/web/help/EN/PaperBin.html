For deleted documents apply the same safety criteria as for any document. If permissions were not available to view a document, you can not see or locate it in the bin either. </p>
<p>Selecting any of the documents listed, you can see at the top of values ​​assigned to the document metadata (in the Web client, in Swing is all on the list). Clicking on the title, you can see the file associated with that document.</p>
