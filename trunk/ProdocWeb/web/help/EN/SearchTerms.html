    <li><b>Author</b>: Filter the terms created or modified by an user.(eg. "John Smith").</li>
    <li><b>Date</b>: Filter the terms by creation or modification date. The modification date is changed not only by modifying metadata but by inserting folders or documents in a folder.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li><b>Narrow Terms</b>: By default, the system will search terms regardless of location. If checked, the search is restricted only to the current term and any specific terms to any number of levels. This allows you to search under any term like a microthesaurus.</li>
</ul>
