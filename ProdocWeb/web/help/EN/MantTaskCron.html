<p>Selecting <b>Test</b> OPD runs a search for the elements that fill the criteria specified (Document type, folders, dates,. ) and shows a list with the elements found so you can check that the criteria is correct and returns the expected set of documents or folders.
This search doesn't apply to operations as import that don't manage existing objects in the repository.</p>
<p>Selecting <b>Run</b> you RUN the task only once with the defined criteria, so beware that you can delete or modify thousands of elements.</p>
