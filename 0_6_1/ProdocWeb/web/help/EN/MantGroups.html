<p>Should be noted that a group can contains other groups and so on indefinitely, so that it can be structured the representation of the organization. You can also include a group in several groups, so that for example can be a group "Consultants in Cambridge" and included in the groups "Cambridge" and "Consultants".
     Similarly you can create a group "Cambridge Managers" is included in the groups "Managers" and "Cambridge". This allows you to assign permissions and access to the necessary elements in a simple and flexible way.</p>
